# 🎬 Movie & TV Show Recommendation System

This project implements a **Recommendation System** that suggests movies and TV shows to users based on different filtering techniques. It utilizes a hybrid approach combining **content-based filtering** and **collaborative filtering** to enhance recommendation accuracy and user personalization.

## 📌 Key Features

* ✅ **Content-Based Filtering** based on genre, description, and keywords
* ✅ **Collaborative Filtering** using user-item interaction matrix
* ✅ **Hybrid Recommendation System** that merges content and collaborative outputs
* 📈 Cosine Similarity and Matrix Factorization (SVD) for predictions
* 📊 Visualizations of recommendation patterns
* 🧠 Built using Python, Pandas, Scikit-Learn, and Surprise library

## 🛠️ How to Run

1. Clone this repository or download the `.ipynb` file:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/anushka-0907/movie-tv-recommendation-system.git
cd movie-tv-recommendation-system
```

2. Install required dependencies:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn surprise matplotlib seaborn nltk
```

3. Open the notebook in Jupyter or Google Colab:

```bash
jupyter notebook Movie_TV_Recommendation_System.ipynb
```

4. Run each cell sequentially to:

   * Load and preprocess the data
   * Build and evaluate different recommendation models
   * Generate personalized recommendations

## 💡 Recommendation Techniques Used

| Technique               | Description                                                                |
| ----------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Content-Based Filtering | Uses metadata (genre, description) and cosine similarity                   |
| Collaborative Filtering | Based on user ratings matrix (Surprise SVD)                                |
| Hybrid Approach         | Combines content and collaborative filters for more robust recommendations |

## 📊 Sample Output

* Top 10 Recommendations for a given movie
* User-specific suggestions based on similar taste
* Nearest neighbors from cosine similarity
* SVD-predicted ratings for unseen items

---

## 🚀 Future Improvements

* Add deep learning-based recommenders (e.g., AutoEncoders, Neural CF)
* Deploy as a web app with Flask or Streamlit
* Integrate real-time movie databases (e.g., TMDB API)
* Include user registration and feedback collection
